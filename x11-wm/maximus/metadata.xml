	<longdescription lang="en">
	A desktop daemon which will automatically maximise and, optionally,
	un-decorate windows. Has support for exclusion lists and will work with any
	EWMH-spec compliant window-manager.

	Created for netbook environments where normally every window is maximised
	and removing the titlebar would give an extra 24px for the application to
	display.
