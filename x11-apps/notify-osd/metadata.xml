	Canonical's on-screen-display notification agent, implementing the
	freedesktop.org Desktop Notifications Specification with semi-transparent
	click-through bubbles.

	Notify OSD presents these notifications as ephemeral overlays, which can be
	clicked through so they don't block your work. It queues notifications, to
	prevent them from flooding your screen. And as well as handling standard
	notification updates, Notify OSD introduces the idea of appending --
	allowing notifications to grow over time, for example in the case of instant
	messages from a particular person.
